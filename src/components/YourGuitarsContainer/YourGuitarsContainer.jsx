                "The Ibanez RGMS8 Iron Label Multi Scale 8 String has been sculpted for players traveling to the darkest depths of tonal destruction by offering an extended frequency range and an incredibly comfortable performance. Its multi-scale neck and fingerboard delivers luxury, while the 5-piece maple and walnut construction offers a stable performance. The combination of the mahogany body and jatoba fingerboard provides a balanced tonal character, with plenty of punch and low-end thunder for extra clarity. Its set of Array-8 MS humbuckers are designed to accommodate the extended frequency range, offering powerfully deep tones saturated in sonic thunder. It also features a monorail bridge, which has been built to accommodate its multi-scale design, offering incredible string stability while delivering the perfect articulation across all the strings."
